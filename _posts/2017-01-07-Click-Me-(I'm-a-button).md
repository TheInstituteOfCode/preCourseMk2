We’ve all clicked on buttons on websites - without buttons your website wouldn’t work!

Buttons are actually quite easy to add in, and the beauty of buttons is that they are just styled anchors links.

Generally, when styling buttons we add borders in - borders prevent your button from blending in with the background of your website.
