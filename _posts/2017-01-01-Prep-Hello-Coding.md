Before we get started learning HTML & CSS it's helpful to have a bit of an overview of the industry as a whole.

While the rest of the lessons in this series are hands-on, this lesson is more theoretical -- we talk through common terminology, explain the difference between front-end and back-end, how a website works, etc.

This lesson is helpful for empowering you to talk-the-talk with developers and better understand all the coding lingo.
