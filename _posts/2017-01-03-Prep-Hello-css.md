CSS controls the style of websites -- it takes the elements that we create through HTML (the sections, paragraphs, headings, links etc) and styles them.

Through CSS we can control colors, fonts, backgrounds, the position of elements on the page and more. Without CSS the web would be very boring indeed.

In this lesson we'll show you how to write custom CSS code.
